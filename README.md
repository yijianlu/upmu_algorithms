# Quick introduction

## Uploading a new algorithm

If you are unfamiliar with the git command line interface, then I recommend editing the files directly on Github. Create a directory with your initials, and place your algorithms inside them

## Connecting to the server

The server is 'dists.cal-sdb.org' and you can connect over port 7500. If you are finding that the username and password are not working, it's probably because you forgot the port.

```
ssh -p 7500 user@dists.cal-sdb.org
```

The username and password are distributed out of band. Email m.andersen@cs.berkeley.edu if you need to know what they are.

## Running an algorithm

On the server, go into ~upmu/alg/ and execute your desired algorithm. You can use GNU screen to detach and leave it running if required.

## Killing a rampant algorithm

On occasion, a bug in your program at just the wrong spot can cause an endless string of errors. If the normal method of aborting an algorithm (Ctrl-c) fails, you may need to stop it (Ctrl-z), then taking note of the job number, kill the job with kill -9. As an example:

```
upmu@dists:~/alg/MPA$ python example_sin.py 
we inserted new version
we inserted new version
CONNECTED TO ARCHIVER

upmu@dists:~/alg/MPA$ kill -9 %3
[3]+  Stopped                 python example_sin.py
upmu@dists:~/alg/MPA$ jobs
[3]+  Killed                  python example_sin.py
```
